## Collaborators:

Jason Q, Dar-Ci C, Anthony H, Seamus B

## What we learned:

- Very important to run a `git pull` command on a group project before continuing to work on a document.

- Bob, Carol, Ted and Alice could have done better by communicating who was doing what.

- Making changes on branches lessens the likelihood that should we run into problems with Git, we are less likely to compromise our remote repository.

- No one works on merge conflicts by themselves

- Our group established from this lab assignment that we will work on our own branches and ACP to that branch to minimize conflicts.

- **Bob and Carol**: Bob and Carol should have run a `git pull` command before continuing to work on the project. They made changes not having the most recent copy of the document from the remote repository.

- **Ted and Alice**: They could have reminded the group to `git pull` before continuing to work. Overcommunication is better than not communicating enough.
